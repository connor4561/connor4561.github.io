        <h2 style="color:white">The Original iRobot</h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px; color:white">This movie is where the whole franchise started. The only major film produced by J2L Industries, it was J2L's largest film ever, filmed across two days and locations. When J2L Industries flatlined, J2L Studios appropriated them, and added long called for sequels to iRobot. 
            Later, they would create a special edition variant of the first movie, featuring more realistic time/location cards, upgraded picture/sound, and music. J2L Industries does continue to exist within J2L Studios, but does not create any major films.

        <p style="font-size:20px; color:white">We understand that chronology can be confusing, especially with a series like ours. The combination of books, movies, and mini episodes create a timeline hard for even their creators to remember. So if you get confused here is a
