        <p style="font-size:20px; color:white">My name is Liam O'Brien, and I'm a Computer Information Systems major at Bradley University. I'm currently enrolled in an LAS 102 class titled "'Life Without Liberty': 
            Mass Incarceration and Prison Abolition Movements". For this class, myself and the other students are assigned to create several blog posts on a number of topics over the course of the semester. These topics will mostly be focused on the United States, but will also touch on other countries' systems. This humble website that I originally created in 7th grade is where I will be hosting my blog, mostly because it's free and I already had the url. Unfortunately, I've forgotten any of the more advanced website design techniques I learned years ago, so this page won't be getting very fancy. Maybe a few pictures later on, if we're lucky.
            <br><br>
            Now if you, dear reader, do not know who I am, what this class is, or how you stumbled upon my website that is presumably buried deep in the depths of the internet, that is understandable. In fact, I am almost certain that I am writing this paragraph for no reason, as no one it is addressed to will ever read it. However, in the off chance someone does, I commend your curiosity that you have read this far already, and welcome you to read on. Maybe it will be interesting to you, maybe it won't. But you've come this far already, why not continue. Presumably, this blog should update every so often, and have five posts by late November, 2023. After that, I will almost certainly forget about this website until I can find some use for it again.

        <h2 style="font-size:30px; color:white">Post #1 - My Preexisting Thoughts on and Knowledge of the Criminal Justice System </h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:25px; color:white">8/27/2023 </h3>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I'd say I have more of a connection to the criminal justice system in the US than most other people. Fortunately not because myself or anyone I know has been incarcerated, but because my father is a lawyer who spent 17 years working as a public defender, and now works as an Illinois state appellate defender. And so naturally, through him talking about his job that he's had for nearly my entire life, I've learned a thing or two about it. I've also picked up information here and there from other sources- the HBO show <i>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</i> springs to mind for its excellent coverage of civil rights and criminal justice issues over the years. This means that I'm most familiar with Illinois state law, followed by federal law. Of course, state law varies a lot state to state so I'll do my best to keep that in mind and not generalize what I know of Illinois to apply to every state. So that's a brief summary of my existing knowledge base, now I have to apply it to some questions that are probably designed to set a baseline for what I learn or if my viewpoints change over the course of the semester.

        <p class="blog_post">
            <ins>1) How many people do I think are incarcerated in the United States?</ins>
            <br>
            I know that the answer is somewhere in the low millions. I saw soemthing recently that makes me think around 2 million? Of course it's easy to search for the answer (a brief amount of research suggests the population is currently at around 1.9 million across a variety of carceral institutions), but that's not the point of this question. I was pretty close though, so that's neat.
            
            <br><br>
            <ins>2) Who do I think of when I hear about “prisoners?” What types of people are incarcerated and what do I think are some of the most common crimes?</ins>
            <br>
            This is a difficult question to answer, because my immediate response and my though out response are very different. The immediate, quick-reaction response when I hear "prisoner" has a negative connotation. I think of them as probably someone who commited some kind of crime, and is now being punished for it. But if I actually think about it, applying my knowledge and not just doing quick word association, I know that what "prisoner" means can be very complicated. People are imprisoned for different crimes, of different severities. Some may be remorseful, others not. Some may have had a some kind of reasoning or excuse, others not. Some may not have even committed a crime at all. The existence of exonerated people indicates that though we don't know the exact number, some number of prisoners are probably completely innocent.
            <br>
            I also know that some people have been in prison for things that are no longer crimes. The clearest example of this that I have heard of was prisoners convicted of marijuana related crimes, often sentenced under mandatory minimum sentencing laws (a topic for later), who remained in prison even after their actions were legalized in their state. People who would no longer be arrested and <i>sent</i> to prison for their previous actions, but yet remained prisoners simply because the system wasn't designed to help people like them.
            <br>
            Or, on a lower level, there are inmates in jails (not technically prisoners, just incarcerated people) who remain in jail only because they do not have the means to post bail. Sometimes, these people even wind up stuck in jail for <i>longer</i> than they would have spent in jail if they had been found guilty and sentenced immediately. The point is, "prisoners" and incarcerated people in general are a complex group, including everything from the most heinous individuals on earth to innocent people incorrectly targeted by the system that should exist to protect them.
            <br>
            And to answer the last part of the question: if I had to guess I'd say that the most common crimes causing incarceration are drug crimes, followed up in no partciular order by the various forms of theft and robbery, "white collar" crimes like fraud, and violent crimes like assault (but not including anything on the level of your class A or X felonies, like murder or sex crimes.) I might be wildly over-estimating some of those, but the drug crimes at least are pretty much a shoe-in for first place. The so-called "War on Drugs" was certainly effective at sending people to prison. (It's effectiveness at protecting the public, on the other hand... is a separate topic that I don't intend to touch today.)
            
            <br><br>
            <ins>3) What does “mass incarceration” mean?</ins>
            <br>
            It means a significant portion of the population is incarcerated. Where the line between normal and mass incarceration is drawn, I'm not sure. But when you have an entire massively profitable industry surrounding the operation of prisons in your country, you've probably crossed the line.
            
            <br><br>
            <ins>What does the word “criminal” mean to me?</ins>
            <br>
            This is ultimately quite similar to my response to question #2. At first thought, it is a plainly negative term, but in reality it covers a range of people so broad that it cannot be simplified down to being "good" or "bad". For the sake of simplicity, I would apply the label of "criminal" to anyone who has violated the law of a jurisdiction, within said jurisdiction. A few examples: If you violate Indiana law in Illinois, you're not a criminal. If you don't violate the law but are convicted, you're not a criminal. If you <i>do</i> violate the law, but <i>aren't</i> convicted, then you're still a criminal. I intentionally leave morality out of the equation here, and use "criminal" as a legal term following the letter of the law. And with who is and isn't a criminal so-defined, moral judgement can be passed on each individual individually, based on their circumstances. Some examples of morally complicated circumstances: someone who steals to feed their family, harms or kills an abuser, or commits a drug crime because of an addiction started by a legal prescription. I'd give special note to how some people can be labeled a criminal in one jurisdiction for doing that is completely normal elsewhere. See, for example, the large number of countries across the world where homosexuality is a punishable crime, compared to countries where it is a legal right. The point I'm getting at here is that the label "criminal" is an inherently reductive term given its scope, and so cannot be used to make any generalized assumptions about the people it applies to. It isn't inherently negative or positive, but is a neutral descriptor.
