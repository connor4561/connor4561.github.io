        <p class="introduction">
            My name is Liam O'Brien, and I'm a Computer Information Systems major at Bradley University. I'm currently enrolled in an LAS 102 class titled "'Life Without Liberty': Mass Incarceration and Prison Abolition Movements". For this class, myself and the other students are assigned to create several blog posts on a number of topics over the course of the semester. These topics will mostly be focused on the United States, but will also touch on other countries' systems. This humble website that I originally created in 7th grade is where I will be hosting my blog, mostly because it's free and the url already exists. Unfortunately, I've forgotten any of the more advanced website design techniques I learned years ago, so this page probably won't be getting very fancy. Maybe a few pictures later on, if we're lucky.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction">
            Now if you, dear reader, do not know who I am, what this class is, or how you stumbled upon my website that is presumably buried deep in the depths of the internet, that is understandable. In fact, I am almost certain that I am writing this paragraph for no reason, as no one it is addressed to will ever read it. However, in the off chance someone does, I commend your curiosity that you have read this far already, and welcome you to read on. Maybe it will be interesting to you, maybe it won't. But you've come this far already, why not continue. Presumably, this blog should update every so often, and have five posts by late November, 2023. After that, I will almost certainly forget about this website until I can find some use for it again.

        <h2 style="font-size:30px; color:white">Post #1 - My Preexisting Thoughts on and Knowledge of the Criminal Justice System </h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:25px; color:white">8/27/2023 </h3>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I'd say I have more of a connection to the criminal justice system in the US than most other people. Fortunately not because myself or anyone I know has been incarcerated, but because my father is a lawyer who spent 17 years working as a public defender, and now works as an Illinois state appellate defender. And so naturally, through him talking about his job that he's had for nearly my entire life, I've learned a thing or two about it. I've also picked up information here and there from other sources- the HBO show <i>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</i> springs to mind for its excellent coverage of civil rights and criminal justice issues over the years. This means that I'm most familiar with Illinois state law, followed by federal law. Of course, state law varies a lot state to state so I'll do my best to keep that in mind and not generalize what I know of Illinois to apply to every state. So that's a brief summary of my existing knowledge base, now I have to apply it to some questions that are probably designed to set a baseline for what I learn or if my viewpoints change over the course of the semester.
        </p>

        
        <p class="question"><ins>1) How many people do I think are incarcerated in the United States?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I know that the answer is somewhere in the low millions. I think somewhere around 2 million? Of course it's easy to search for the answer (a brief amount of research suggests the population is currently at around 1.9 million across a variety of carceral institutions), but that's not the point of this question. I was pretty close though, so that's neat.
            

        <p class="question"><ins>2) Who do I think of when I hear about “prisoners?” What types of people are incarcerated and what do I think are some of the most common crimes?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            This is a difficult question to answer, because my immediate response and my thought out response are very different. The immediate, quick-reaction response when I hear "prisoner" has a negative connotation. I think of them as probably someone who commited some kind of crime, and is now being punished for it. But if I actually think about it, applying my knowledge and not just doing quick word association, I know that what "prisoner" means can be very complicated. People are imprisoned for different crimes, of different severities. Some may be remorseful, others not. Some may have had a some kind of reasoning or excuse, others not. Some may not have even committed a crime at all. The existence of exonerated people indicates that though we don't know the exact number, some number of prisoners are probably completely innocent.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I also know that some people have been in prison for things that are no longer crimes. The clearest example of this that I have heard of was prisoners convicted of marijuana related crimes, often sentenced under mandatory minimum sentencing laws (a topic for later), who remained in prison even after their actions were legalized in their state. People who would no longer be arrested and <i>sent</i> to prison for their previous actions, but yet remained prisoners simply because the system wasn't designed to help people like them.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            Or, on a lower level, there are inmates in jails (not technically prisoners, just incarcerated people) who remain in jail only because they do not have the means to post bail. Sometimes, these people even wind up stuck in jail for <i>longer</i> than they would have spent in jail if they had been found guilty and sentenced immediately. The point is, "prisoners" and incarcerated people in general are a complex group, including everything from the most heinous individuals on earth to innocent people incorrectly targeted by the system that should exist to protect them.
        </p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            And to answer the last part of the question: if I had to guess I'd say that the most common crimes causing incarceration are drug crimes, followed up in no partciular order by the various forms of theft and robbery, "white collar" crimes like fraud, and violent crimes like assault (but not including anything on the level of your class A or X felonies, like murder or sex crimes.) I might be wildly over-estimating some of those, but the drug crimes at least are pretty much a shoe-in for first place. The so-called "War on Drugs" was certainly effective at sending people to prison. (It's effectiveness at protecting the public, on the other hand... is a separate topic that I don't intend to touch today.)
        </p>
        
        <p class="question"><ins>3) What does “mass incarceration” mean?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">    
            It means a significant portion of the population is incarcerated. Where the line between normal and mass incarceration is drawn, I'm not sure. But when you have an entire massively profitable industry surrounding the operation of prisons in your country, you've probably crossed the line.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question"><ins>4) What does the word “criminal” mean to me?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            This is ultimately quite similar to my response to question #2. At first thought, it is a plainly negative term, but in reality it covers a range of people so broad that it cannot be simplified down to being "good" or "bad". For the sake of simplicity, I would apply the label of "criminal" to anyone who has violated the law of a jurisdiction, within said jurisdiction. A few examples: If you violate Indiana law in Illinois, you're not a criminal. If you don't violate the law but are convicted, you're not a criminal. If you <i>do</i> violate the law, but <i>aren't</i> convicted, then you're still a criminal. I intentionally leave morality out of the equation here, and use "criminal" as a legal term following the letter of the law. And with who is and isn't a criminal so-defined, moral judgement can be passed on each individual individually, based on their circumstances. Some examples of morally complicated circumstances: someone who steals to feed their family, harms or kills an abuser, or commits a drug crime because of an addiction started by a legal prescription. I'd give special note to how some people can be labeled a criminal in one jurisdiction for doing that is completely normal elsewhere. See, for example, the large number of countries across the world where homosexuality is a punishable crime, compared to countries where it is a legal right. The point I'm getting at here is that the label "criminal" is an inherently reductive term given its scope, and so cannot be used to make any generalized assumptions about the people it applies to. It isn't inherently negative or positive, but is a neutral descriptor.
        </p>

        <p class="question"><ins>5) What are conditions in jails and prisons like, based on what I have seen, heard, or experienced? </ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            The conditions are bad, even at the best of times. Prison cells are small and uncomfortable. The prisons themselves can lack air conditioning, even in extremely hot climates. Since the 13th ammendment specifically allows slavery as a punishment for a crime, prisoners can be forced to work for little or no pay and be punished if they don't comply. Solitary confinement continues to exist, and continues to psychologically torment those placed into it. Being a prisoner can also be quite expensive, as basic sanitary products are not always free, or are provided in too low of a quantity, forcing inmates to purchase them from the prison's store. Communicating with or receiving money from family and friends can also be expensive, and private companies have stepped in to ensure that the process is filled with as many unnecessary fees as possible. Both prisons and jails proved terribly ineffective at protecting their inmates' health during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Cook County jail in Illinois even being described, memorably, as a "death cruise ship" by a local attorney. And I'm certain there's much more that I can't remember or don't even know about.
        </p>

        <p class="question"><ins>6) What do I think the purpose of incarceration is? Is it effective?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I believe that incarceration serves multiple purposes, depending on the nature of the incarcerated individual. Let's also assume for the duration of this question that all laws are morally just. This is a big assumption, but it makes things less complicated. For some, it can have rehabilitative purposes: those who maybe didn't seek out crime, but instead were pushed into it by societal factors. Or who did seek out crime, but are capable of recognizing their wrongs and rejoining society as a productive member. In other cases, were the incarcerated person has no desire to rehabilitate themselves, incarceration serves to keep them separate from society. If they cannot abide by its rules, it is not safe for everyone else to have them out in it. And then there are also regretable cases where an individual may chose to rehabilitate themselves, but has committed so heinous a crime that society as a whole would reject their reintegration. Take, for example, a reformed murderer. Perhaps they do not intend to murder again, perhaps it would be safe to have them in society, but society does not wish to take that chance, and so then incarceration serves not to rehabilitate or secure the individual, but solely as punishment. In a more ideal world I believe incarceration should exist solely to rehabilitate those who commit crimes, with the purpose of reintegrating them into wider society. But in a truly ideal world, no one would require rehabilitation in the first place. Life is not ideal, and so incarceration has to serve many less than ideal purposes. (Including, additionally, deterence. The precise value of the deterence is unclear, but I think it undeniable that it does have <i>some</i> value.)
        </p>

        <p class="question"><ins>7) Where have I heard about prison? What types of media (TV, podcasts, news, social media, etc.) provide this information?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I think it would be faster to list where I haven't heard about prison. Because there isn't anything I can think of. Prison permeates every form of media in some form or another. Prison is in books, TV, music, newspapers, radio, comic books, podcasts, social media... and probably more that I can't quickly think of. Of course the quality of information may vary from source to source. You'll be more likely to get hard facts about prison from a newspaper rather than a comic book, but this doesn't inherently devalue the importance of how prison is displayed in media formats like comics. Even if we wouldn't cite them as a source, they can provide insight into how different people perceive prisons, or how they want prisons to be perceived. I might be familiar with the Knox County Jail, but someone else could be more familiar with the Gotham Jail, and that matters, because it affects their perception.
        </p>

        <p class="question"><ins>8) Am I interested in the criminal justice system? Why or why not?</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I have almost a sense of a morbid curiosity about the criminal justice system. I know enough to know that ignorance would certainly be bliss when it comes to the criminal justice system, but too much to achieve that blissful ignorance. I pay attention to it because I understand the significance but at the same time, I have a hard time actively trying to learn more because around every corner is a new horror to behold. So many lives have been destroyed by it that it is fully impossible to comprehend, and reforming it seems such a monumental task that it would be difficult even if we all agreed it was necessary. And many people <i>don't</i> agree that it's necessary! So, I suppose I do find the criminal justice system interesting. But in the same way a car crash on the interstate is interesting: I'm torn between staring at it and looking away, I hope that no one is hurt or killed by it, and I wish that I'll never be involved in it. And then I keep driving.

        <h2 style="font-size:30px; color:white">Post #2 - Myths and Misconceptions Part 1: Crime and Punishment</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:25px; color:white">9/17/2023 </h3>
        <p class="blog_post">
            Now begins the bread and butter of this blog: explaining why common myths and misconceptions about the criminal justice system <i>are</i> myths and/or misconceptions. I've tried to cover some that are probably most prevalent, but I'll admit I'm not very in tune with the "common man", so to speak. I don't know what most people know (or think they know), only what I know. Anyway, without further ado.
        </p>


        <p class="question"><ins>Myth/Misconception 1: Most people go to trial.</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            I think the common perception is that the criminal justice system follows this simple order: you get arrested, you go to trial, and then you're either set free or go to prison. This is the process that is so often portrayed in movies and tv about the criminal justice system. And while that certainly makes for a reliable dramatic format for shows like <i>Law & Order</i>, the reality of the criminal justice system is far from that "ideal". In the actual criminal justice system, around <i>95%</i> of cases are resolved with a plea deal and never go to trial. For those who aren't familiar with the concept, a plea deal is an arrangement that a defendant makes with the prosecutor, whereby the defendant pleads guilty to the crime they committed in exchange for a less harsh sentence. It is a process that keeps the criminal justice system moving, as it would surely collapse if even half of all cases went to trial. But it is also a process that grants inherently greater power to the prosecutor. No longer does the prosecutor need to meet the burden of "guilt beyond a reasonable doubt" that is required in court, now they just need to make an offer that the defendant can't risk refusing. This can have negative consequences for both those who are guilty and those who aren't, as both can feel pressured to take a deal because they're afraid of what could happen in court. For a more detailed dive into plea deals, and for my sourcing, check out <a href="https://theappeal.org/justice-in-america-episode-2-the-94-plea-deals/">JUSTICE IN AMERICA EPISODE 2: THE 94% — PLEA DEALS</a> from The Appeal.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question"><ins>Myth/Misconception 2: Prisons and jails are essentially the same thing.</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            This is a misconception that, if I had to guess, was mostly born of the "good enough" nature of casual conversation. Since prisons and jails both have cells, guards, and incarcerated people, the distinction may not seem to matter to most people. But to some- those connected to the system, those who have studied it, or the "humble" grammarian (there is no such thing as a humble grammarian), the distinction is both clear and important. A jail is a local facility where people can be behind bars for a number of reasons. People who have been arrested but haven't been charged with a crime yet, people who <i>have</i> been charged with a crime and are not allowed to leave for some reason or another (bail will be addressed later), and those who have been convicted but are sentenced to less than a year of incarceration are the typical jail lot. Prisons, on the other hand, are administered above a local level and hold people who have sentences of longer than a year. To handle these different functions, prisons and jails have considerably different designs and operating structures. 
        </p>

        <p class="question"><ins>Myth/Misconception 3: Ending cash bail could let dangerous people out of jail.</ins></p>
        <p class="blog_post">
            In most places in the United States today, people who are charged with a crime go to jail, but have the chance to bay an amount of money as bond to bail them out (the words "bail" and "bond", while distinct, are very closely realted and often used interchangeably even if they shouldn't be. I probably will mix the two of them up as well). This payment is designed to motivate the person to return for their trial, because if they do, the money is returned to them. In theory, this seems like a good system. Since the the cost of bond is set (mostly) based on the severity of the alleged crime, people who are charged with lesser crimes can continue with their lives until their trial (or, as discussed earlier, their plea deal), whereas those charged with more serious crimes have a harder time getting out. And in certain high-level cases no bond is even set, because there is too much risk in relasing the accused individual. However, there is one teeny tiny very small gaping flaw in this system: wealth disparity. You may or may not have heard someone say before that crimes punishable by a fine are legal for the rich, and this is a similar situation. With bond being set based more on the crime than the accused's ability to pay, poor people can wind up stuck in jail for even very minor crimes, while those with wealth can easily bail themselves out even on more serious charges. Comparatively, proposed or implemented systems that don't require cash bond focus entirely on the severity of the crime and the accused's likelihood of reoffending if released to determine whether or not they must remain in jail. Once again for a more detailed look into the topic you can see <a href="https://theappeal.org/justice-in-america-episode-1-justice-for-the-rich-money-bail/">JUSTICE IN AMERICA EPISODE 1: JUSTICE FOR THE RICH, MONEY BAIL</a> from The Appeal.
